# Stock portfolio
This project has a very simple dashboard which contains a chart to show how a portfolio has developed over a time period from Jan 2017 to June 2021. Details such as income value, risk tolerance etc are hardcoded. The project also has just one view: chart view for CAKE portfolio. Others were not implemented due to time constraints. Details about running the project as well as improvements, and a demo (video) are available towards the end of this document.

## Technologies used

- React
- React hooks
- Apex charts
- Jest (for unit tests)

## Running the project  
The first thing that you can do before getting into the frontend specific details is to install all the dependencies. 

Within the root folder, run `npm i` to install all the dependencies. Once that is done, go ahead and run the command `npm start` to run the frontend. You can then navigate to `http://localhost:3000/` to access the interface.
